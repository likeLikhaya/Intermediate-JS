Day 1 - Frames & Windows

Popups Window Method

- A popup window is an old way to show additional content to users.
- To create a popup, use `window.open('URL')`.
- Popups can be tricky on mobiles due to the absence of multiple windows.
- Some use cases, like Facebook, still use popups because they have their JavaScript environment.
- Popups can open URLs and communicate with the opener window.

Window.open Syntax

- `window.open(URL, name, params)` opens a popup.
- `URL` is the web address to load.
- `name` specifies the popup's name or reuses an existing one.
- `params` configures the popup's properties.

Accessing Popups

- `window.open` returns a reference to the new window.
- You can manipulate its properties and content.
- Example: `let newWin = window.open("about:blank", "hello", "width=200,height=200")`.

Accessing Windows from Popups

- Popups can access the "opener" window using `window.opener`.
- Example: `window.opener.document.body.innerHTML = 'Test'`.

Closing Popups

- To close a window: `win.close()`.
- To check if a window is closed: `win.closed`.

Scrolling and Resizing

- Methods like `win.moveBy(x, y)` and `win.resizeTo(width, height)` can move and resize windows.
- Avoid disabling scrollbars or resizing for user-friendliness.

Day 2 - Cross-Window Communication

Cross-Window Communication

- Windows can communicate if they have the same origin (protocol, domain, port).
- `postMessage` allows secure communication between windows from different origins.
- Example: `window.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.

Day 3 - Clickjacking Attack

Clickjacking Attack

- Clickjacking tricks users into clicking unintended elements.
- Attackers overlay hidden buttons or links on harmless elements.
- Protect against clickjacking with security headers like X-Frame-Options.

Day 4 - ArrayBuffer and binary arrays

Typed Arrays and ArrayBuffer

- Typed arrays are like regular arrays but for binary data.
- They are more efficient and work with binary data.
- Examples: Uint8Array, Uint16Array, Int32Array.

DataView

- DataView provides flexible access to binary data in an ArrayBuffer.
- You specify the format when accessing data.
- Useful for mixed-format data in the same buffer.
